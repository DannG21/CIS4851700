First of all, I had problems with my Git and this repository so it was a disaster trying to commit my final project and I had to restore the project. For that reason it was commited this way.

All completed labs were deleted although at least most of them were already reviewed and graded. The ones that were not graded were labs 14 - 27 - 24 - 25.
